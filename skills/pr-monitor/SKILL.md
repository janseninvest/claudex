# PR / CI Monitor Skill

Use when: checking GitHub repo health, investigating why an alert fired, or adding a new repo to watch.

## Check status of all repos now

node /home/ajans/projects/pr-monitor/status.cjs

## Run monitor now (dry run)

node /home/ajans/projects/pr-monitor/monitor.cjs --dry-run

## Run monitor and send real alerts if needed

node /home/ajans/projects/pr-monitor/monitor.cjs

## Cron

Runs every 30 minutes.

## What it watches

- CI failures on main/master branch
- Open PRs awaiting review for >24h (non-draft, non-WIP)
- Open PRs with failing CI checks
- Stale PRs (no activity in 7 days)

## Repos watched

All janseninvest repos (auto-discovered). Exclusions in config.json.

## Alert cooldown

4 hours per issue — won't spam on persistent failures.

## Config
